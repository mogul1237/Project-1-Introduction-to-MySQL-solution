As an introduction to mysql, you will import and submit queries against a sample
employee database provided with mysql. The database contains about 300,000 employee
records with 2.8 million salary entries. The database size is approximately 167 MB,
which is not huge, but heavy enough to be non-trivial for testing.
This project will use interview grading. 40% of your grade will be based on the
submitted materials. The remaining 60% will come from the interview portion. You
must schedule an interview slot with a grader. If you do not schedule or attend a slot the
interview portion will be scored zero.
Procedure
In this assignment you will import this database, perform various SQL operations on it
and submit the resulting output. You can find the database file on Moodle.
You are responsible for getting access to a mysql environment. You can use the CS
virtual machine or any other machine you want that you can install mysql on. It is an
exercise for the student to install mysql on whatever machine they choose.
In your virtual machine (or whichever Linux environment you are using), install the
sample database into mysql. Follow the instructions on this github page for installation.
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-installation.html
Itâ€™s a good idea to run the validation script that generates and compares checksums to
ensure your installation is correct.
Once you have the database installed, start a mysql client and execute the following
commands:
mysql> show databases;
There should be an employees database listed.
